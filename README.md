## Me
I'm `redpulp` (she/her), a Fullstack Developer with a passion for procedural and physics based graphics. I'm trying to move to a game dev job, but until then, I'll use this account to share some of my experiments.

## Survival
In my day-to-day job I work as a webdev and "Cloud Infrastructure Engineer", which usually means that I design and develop all sorts of web based tools and that I set up their infrastructures in the cloud.
My go-to language is Typescript, but I usually sprinkle some Rust and Python on the the projects I work on.

Here's a colorful list of some relevant tools I've worked with, in no particular order:

## Fun
Ok, now what I really like doing. I have the most fun making stuff that is procedural, portable, and accessible. I love having maximum control with my projects, so I try to build them from scratch, hence their simplicity (I'm only human).
Here's some tools I'm learning to work with, or that I want to try in the future:

I like lists, sorry. Here's some more colors and irrelevant stats:

## What I stand for

I'm an advocate for the use and development of FOSS [as defined by the GNU foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html); software development has only gone so far thanks to the gigantic contribution of people you'll never hear of, it would be ungrateful towards of all them to hide and restrict technological innovation under the banner of "intellectual property". Same goes for hardware, ofc, I support [FOSH](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware?src=open_hardware_resources_menu1) and the Right to repair[^1].

My values lie in equality and accessiblity. I stand for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community, ethnic minorities and disabled people to live a life free of hate and discrimination.
I support the sovereignty of native populations and their fights against colonialism.
